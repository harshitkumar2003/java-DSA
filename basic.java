// How JAVA works:
// java is compiled into to the bytecode and then interpreted to the machine code
// 1. Java source code is written in .java file
// 2. Java compiler compiles the .java file and generates .class file
// 3. Java interpreter reads the .class file and executes the bytecode
// 4. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is used to run the bytecode
// 5. JVM is platform independent
// 6. JVM is a part of Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
// 7. JRE is a part of Java Development Kit (JDK)
// 8. JDK is used to develop Java applications
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// JAVA Installation:
// JDK = "Java Development Kit" collection of tools used for developing and running java programs
// 1. Download the JDK from the official website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html
// 2. Install the JDK by following the instructions on the website

// JRE = "Java Runtime Environment" is a part of JDK that is used to run Java applications/Programs
// 1. Download the JRE from the official website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html
// 2. Install the JRE by following the instructions on the website

// Basic structure of a Java program:
// 1. Class Declaration
// 2. Main Method Declaration
// 3. Print Statement
// 4. End of Class Declaration
// 5. End of Main Method Declaration
// 6. End of Program

public class Basic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
