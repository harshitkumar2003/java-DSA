/* java~ //!Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be secure and portable. Its core principle is “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA), meaning Java code can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
*/ 

/* //! Key Features include:
1. Object-Oriented: Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
2. Platform Independence: Runs on any OS with JVM.
3. Robust & Secure: Strong memory management and exception handling.
4. Multithreading: Efficient concurrent execution.
5. Rich API: Extensive standard libraries for networking, I/O, collections, etc.
6. Scalability: Suitable for small to enterprise-level applications.
*/

/* //! Java Development Environment:
To run Java on your machine, you first need to set up the Java environment properly. This includes configuring the required environment variables (such as PATH and JAVA_HOME).
TODO_The development environment of Java consists of three components mainly:
1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine): JVM is the engine that runs Java programs. It converts Java bytecode (compiled code) into machine code (understandable by the OS).
2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment): JRE = JVM + Libraries + Other components needed to run Java applications.
3. JDK (Java Development Kit): JDK = JRE + Development Tools. It is required for developing Java applications.
